# legbot
Discord bot intended to help those who need to inject medication intramuscularly on a weekly basis into the leg. 

Please do not judge it too harshly, this was just a quick bot put together on a lunch break.

# Deprecation Notice

This project was just a quick lunch break project, and I had no intention on maintining it. For an actively maintained (and easier to deploy!) version of this, I encourage you to check out [legbot-go](https://github.com/Jess-v/legbot-go). 

## Installation
>pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Generate config.py
In the root directory create file named config.py

Edit the following and paste into the file:
>token = "place_token_here"

## Usage
To ask the bot to remind you which leg to inject into next week just state either of the following:

"left leg next week"

"right leg next week"

To ask for a reminder on which leg to inject into just state:

"which leg"
